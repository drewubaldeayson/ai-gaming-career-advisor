              **Saudi Market-Specific Pain Points:**
              1. Many Saudis are only aware of "Game Developer" and "Game Artist" roles but do not realize the diversity of career paths available in gaming.
              2. Many Saudis want to work in a gaming company but don't know where to start or how to build a career path.
              3. Some individuals may feel uncomfortable sharing their weaknesses or personal career concerns with a human career advisor.
              4. Many people struggle with "unknown unknowns"—they don’t know what to ask or where to begin, making structured guidance essential.
